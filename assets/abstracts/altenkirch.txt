Coinduction in Cubical Agda

In intensional Type Theory (pre-HoTT) there is an annoying asymmetry:
while inductive proofs boil down to using pattern matching and
structural recursion via the proposition-as-types explanation,
coinduction is not provable and has to be encoded via setoids or
introduced as an axiom destroying the computational adequacy of type
theory.

Here cubical type theory ala cubical agda offers a nice symmetry: as
induction is provable from pattern-matching and structural recursion;
coinduction is provable from copattern-matching and guarded
corecrursion. However, once we try to dualize some interesting examples,
eg using conatural numbers, things start to get a bit hairy. We need
to be careful to expose the mutual structure of CoNat which is
actually coinductive-inductive but we run into additional problems when
using transitivity as is required to prove commutativity of addition
on conaturals.

The goal of my talk is first of all to explain the symmetry of
induction and coinduction in cubical agda but also highlight the issues
which are arising. This is open eded, I don't really have a satisfying
solution in the moment, but will sketch some possible approaches.
